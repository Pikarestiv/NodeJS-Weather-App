This is a Weather App built with Node JS for obtaining weather information for different cities worldwide.

REQUIREMENTS:
You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your machine.
You also have to create an API key at [Open Weather Map](http://www.openweathermap.org) and import it and pass in the key into the query URL.

To Use:
Clone the repository.
CD to the repository folder and run the following command in your terminal:

node index.js CITYNAME

Where CITYNAME represents the name of the city you want to obtain its temperature.

If you do not add the CITYNAME, by default, you will get the current weather of Lagos City.

Look through the response.data object for other weather data apart from the temperature.
